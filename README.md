# Simple Todo App

This simple project creates a simple Todo list where you can create a task and give it a Due date.

## Functionality

In this project, I created a components folder and added several other files like Todo.js, PopupWithForm.js, Popup.js, and TodoCounter.js. This is is create better functionallity and to have more organized and cleaner code.

## Technology

I imorted and exported in between files so that way everything wasn't all together in index.js. doing this helped improve the functionallity of the Todo app.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
